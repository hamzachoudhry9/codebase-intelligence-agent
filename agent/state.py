"""
state.py — The AgentState TypedDict that flows through every LangGraph node.

Every node receives the current state dict and returns a partial dict with
only the keys it modifies. LangGraph merges updates automatically.

The `messages` field uses operator.add as its reducer so each node's
returned messages are appended rather than overwriting the list.

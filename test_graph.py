"""
test_graph.py — Smoke test for the full LangGraph agent.

FIX (Bug 6): initial_state now includes ALL keys required by AgentState:
             query, past_context, plan, current_step_index, messages,
             tool_outputs, final_answer, replan_count, done.

             The original test only had 3 of these 9 keys. memory_retrieval_node
             immediately crashed with KeyError because it accessed state["query"]
             which technically existed, but should_replan accessed state["plan"]
             which did not — causing an unhandled KeyError mid-graph.

Run from the project root (with venv activated):
    python test_graph.py
